abstract: "This year our interests in teaching plant science (Dan), robotics (Bill), and ecology-based climate research (John) came together nicely through a combination of hard work and collaboration into the creation of a ClimateCase that, with sensors, actuators, 3D-printed parts, and microcontrollers, can create ecology-in-a-box, including replicating the outside climate inside the classroom."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "LAS is helping with Citizen Science and doing yearly Transect studies on species, we also wanted to build a way to simulate projected changes and see if we could assess plant survivability."
