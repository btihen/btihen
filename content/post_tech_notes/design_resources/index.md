## SVG Text Logos

Sometimes I find it hard to come up with a good logo, but not a shortname.

**Wide larger Logo** _(for Desktop views)_

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<svg viewBox="0 0 240 45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <style>
    .heavy { font: bold 30px sans-serif; fill: blue;}
    .small { font: italic 25px sans-serif; fill: green; }
  </style>
  <text x="0" y="35" class="heavy" fill="blue">ED</text>
  <text x="41" y="35" class="small" fill="green">gility</text>
</svg>
```


**Small stacked logo** _(for mobile views)_

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<svg viewBox="0 0 45 45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <style>
    .heavy { font: bold 28px sans-serif; fill: blue;}
    .small { font: italic 18px sans-serif; fill: green; }
  </style>
  <text x="0" y="22" class="heavy" fill="blue">ED</text>
  <text x="0" y="40" class="small" fill="green">gility</text>
</svg>

```
